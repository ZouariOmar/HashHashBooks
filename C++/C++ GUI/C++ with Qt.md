-  #Qt is a **C++** framework that supports the WOCA (Write Once, Compile Anywhere) principle, which means Qt is a cross-platform framework. It's mainly used to develop applications and graphical user interfaces (GUIs) that can run across different operating systems.
- #SDK stands for **Software Development Kit**. An SDK is **a set of tools to build software for a particular platform**. These tools also allow an app developer to build an app which can integrate with another program–i.e. a mobile measurement partner (MMP) like Adjust.
- **Qt SDK** leverages the power of the Qt framework and tools, combining them with tools designed specifically to streamline the creation of applications for mobile platforms, such as Symbian and Maemo in addition to desktop platforms, such as Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux.
